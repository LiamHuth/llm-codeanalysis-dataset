\begin{abstract}
  This research paper primarily focuses on the creation of an integrated dataset to investigate its impact on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically in the context of static analysis for software security. Recognizing a gap in the capabilities of LLMs like ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo in accurately identifying and analyzing critical software vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, and path traversal, we hypothesize that this shortfall is partly due to the lack of specialized training datasets. To test this hypothesis, we developed a comprehensive dataset encompassing these specific vulnerabilities. Our approach involved fine-tuning ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo-0613 with this dataset and comparing its performance with its original version, as well as with other advanced models such as ChatGPT-4.0 and ChatGPT-4.0-1106 Preview. The evaluation focused on the models' proficiency in vulnerability detection, tracing the source and sink of these vulnerabilities, and analyzing the output quality. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score were employed to assess improvements. The findings of this study aim to validate whether the integration of a tailored dataset can indeed enhance the effectiveness of LLMs in static analysis tasks, thereby contributing to the broader field of AI-assisted software security. Additionally, by making this dataset open-source, we encourage community collaboration and further research in this vital area.

\section{Introduction}
The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo marks a significant advancement in the field of computational research. Their application spans a wide range of disciplines, from natural language processing to intricate problem-solving, highlighting their versatility and ever-expanding knowledge base. One area where LLMs are poised to make substantial contributions is in static analysis – a crucial component of software development and security. Static analysis involves the scrutiny of code without its execution, a task where precision and accuracy are paramount.
Despite their prowess in various domains, LLMs demonstrate a noticeable shortcoming in static analysis, particularly in the detection of specific vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, and path traversal. This discrepancy between their potential and actual performance in static analysis raises important questions and necessitates a thorough investigation.

This paper posits that one key factor limiting LLMs' effectiveness in vulnerability detection could be their limited exposure to specialized datasets in this area. To test this hypothesis, we aim to curate a dedicated dataset and assess its impact on enhancing LLMs' capability in identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities.

In summary, our research seeks to bridge the gap in LLM performance through targeted dataset curation and training. We present the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The development and validation of a specialized dataset tailored for tuning ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo-0613 in detecting SQL injection, command injection, and path traversal vulnerabilities.
  \item A comparative study of the performance of LLMs before and after training with this dataset.
  \end{itemize}

Our research aims to not only improve LLMs in static analysis of software vulnerabilities but also contribute to AI-assisted software security discourse. Crucially, we will develop an open-source dataset, inviting community collaboration to enhance and diversify our approach. This step is fundamental in leveraging collective expertise for advancing AI applications in software security.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Inaccurate Identification and Communication of Line Location}
A major challenge we faced was the inaccurate identification and communication of line locations for sources and sinks in the code. This inaccuracy often occurred as ChatGPT sometimes overlooked empty lines or lines containing only comments. Precise line localization is vital for accurately pinpointing vulnerabilities in code. To mitigate this issue, we implemented a script to add line numbers to the start of each line in our dataset. This enhancement aims to improve the model's precision in pinpointing the exact lines where vulnerabilities begin (source) and where they could potentially lead to an exploit (sink). Accurate identification of these specific line locations is essential, as it enables developers to more effectively and efficiently address and rectify vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Time-Consuming and Less Diverse Dataset Creation}
The development of our dataset was a particularly time-intensive task, largely due to the detailed process necessary for ensuring that it included precise and relevant instances of SQL injection, command injection, and path traversal vulnerabilities. In the course of creating this dataset, we also faced challenges regarding its diversity. Here, diversity encompasses the variety of programming languages, coding styles, and the complexity levels of the vulnerabilities. This aspect is crucial because a dataset with a broader range of attributes could significantly enhance the model's ability to generalize its learning to a wider array of real-world scenarios.

To address these issues, we adopted a dual approach for dataset compilation. Half of our dataset was meticulously crafted in-house, ensuring a high level of detail and accuracy. The other half was sourced from the community, utilizing resources such as open-source repositories on GitHub, various technical blogs, and existing datasets. This hybrid approach was intended to strike a balance between precision and diversity, harnessing the breadth of community knowledge and insights while maintaining a strong focus on the quality and relevance of the data points.

\subsection{Number of Epochs Choosing Strategy}
In the process of model tuning, we faced the risk of underfitting and overfitting. We experimented with 1, 3, and 10 epochs for training and found that training for 3 epochs offered the best balance. Training for only one epoch led to underfitting, where the model was unable to learn enough from the dataset, while 10 epochs led to overfitting, where the model became too tailored to the training dataset and less effective at generalizing to new data. Finding the optimal number of epochs was crucial for achieving the best model performance.

\subsection{Dataset Splitting Strategy and Trade-off}
Determining the ideal division of our dataset presented a significant challenge, particularly given its relatively modest size, comprising only 25 SQL injection (SQLi), 15 path traversal, 15 command (cmd) injection, and 30 clean code cases. After careful consideration, we opted for a 60/10/30 split for training, validation, and testing. This allocation provided a substantial volume of data for training, ensuring that the model could learn effectively from a wide array of examples. However, it also meant that the validation set, which plays a critical role in model tuning during the training phase, was comparatively small.

The decision to allocate 30\% of our limited dataset to testing was strategic, driven by our aim to strengthen the robustness of our conclusions. Given the small number of cases, particularly in the categories of SQLi, path traversal, and cmd injection, it was imperative to have a more extensive testing dataset. This approach allowed us to evaluate the model's performance on a broader spectrum of unseen data, thereby providing a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of its capabilities in identifying and mitigating these specific types of vulnerabilities. The trade-off in reducing the size of the validation dataset was a necessary step to achieve this goal, ensuring that our findings were grounded in a solid and extensive testing process.

\subsection{Dataset Ground Truth Validity}
Ensuring the validity of the ground truth in our dataset was a crucial aspect of our project, given its direct impact on the model's learning efficacy. Ground truth, referring to the accuracy of data labeling, is essential for the model to learn and make correct predictions. Our team, comprised of just two members, faced inherent limitations, particularly in the breadth of expertise across various software vulnerabilities. To address this, we relied on peer reviews for validating our data. However, even with peer reviews, there remained the possibility of gaps in our dataset's comprehensiveness and precision, given the limited range of expertise among our reviewers.

In our labeling process, our team achieved a high consensus rate, agreeing on 76 out of 80 cases, which translates to a 95\% agreement rate. This high level of agreement underscores the rigorousness of our approach. However, the experience also highlighted the need for more diverse expertise in the creation and validation of such datasets.

In light of this, one of our primary objectives is to develop this dataset as an open-source project. The aim here is to invite participation from a broader community of experts and enthusiasts in software security. By opening up our dataset to the community, we hope to attract contributions from individuals with a wide range of expertise and perspectives. This collaborative approach is expected to significantly enhance the validity and reliability of our dataset. The community's input can help in identifying and correcting any overlooked vulnerabilities, thereby enriching the dataset and making it a more robust tool for training models in software vulnerability detection. This initiative is not only about expanding the dataset but also about fostering a collaborative environment where collective expertise contributes to advancing the field of AI in software security.

% \section{Sectioning Commands}

% Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
% \verb|section|, \verb|subsection|, \verb|subsubsection|, and
% \verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
% from the commands.

% Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
% a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

% \section{Tables}

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
% package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
% high-quality tables.

% Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

% Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
% them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
% ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
% environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
% table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
% \textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
% columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
% detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
% \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
% placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
% this document.

% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%   \label{tab:freq}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
%     $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
%     \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
%     $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
%   \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
% live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
% contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
% wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
% desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
% instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
% in the printed output of this document.

% \begin{table*}
%   \caption{Some Typical Commands}
%   \label{tab:commands}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Command &A Number & Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table*}

% Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
% use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
% recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
% more easily.

% \section{Math Equations}
% You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
% inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
% discussed in the next sections.

% \subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
% in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
% which can be invoked with the usual
% \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
% the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
% and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
% \LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
% examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
% \begin{math}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{math},
% set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
% set in display style.  (See next section).

% \subsection{Display Equations}
% A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
% text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
% environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
% \textbf{displaymath} environment.

% Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
% structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
% of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
% equation, shown as an inline equation above:
% \begin{equation}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{equation}
% Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
% the \textbf{displaymath}
% environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
% \begin{displaymath}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
% \end{displaymath}
% and follow it with another numbered equation:
% \begin{equation}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
% \end{equation}
% just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

% \section{Figures}

% The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
% more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
% third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
% in the example below.
% \begin{figure}[h]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
%   \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
%     Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
%     Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
%   \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
% \end{figure}

% Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
% the reader.

% Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

% Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
% decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
% who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
% indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

% A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
% characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
%   should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
%   important information that is not already provided in the caption or
%   the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
% complex new information, a short text description may not be
% adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
% appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
% provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
% structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
% regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
% so important, please see
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

% \subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

% A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
% are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
% the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
% figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
% \verb|\maketitle| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{teaserfigure}
%     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
%     \caption{figure caption}
%     \Description{figure description}
%   \end{teaserfigure}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Citations and Bibliographies}

% The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
% references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
% --- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
% (``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
% reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
% article DOI, etc.

% The bibliography is included in your source document with these two

% \section{Acknowledgments}

% Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
% individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
% preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
% section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
% document.

% This section has a special environment:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{acks}
%   ...
%   \end{acks}
% \end{verbatim}
% so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
% during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
% consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

% Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

% \section{Appendices}

% If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
% ``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
% document.

% Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \appendix
% \end{verbatim}
% and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
% numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
% and subsection identification method.

% \section{Multi-language papers}

% Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
% titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a
% rule, a paper in a language other than English should include an
% English title and an English abstract).  Use \verb|language=...| for
% every language used in the paper.  The last language indicated is the
% main language of the paper.  For example, a French paper with
% additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start with
% the following command
% \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
%                language=french]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}

% The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
% language of the paper.  The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX|
% begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
% in the other languages.  The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is
% used to set the translation of the abstract.  These commands and
% environment have a mandatory first argument: the language of the
% second argument.  See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for examples
% of their usage.

% \section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

% The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
% not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
% a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
% ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
% the margin:
% \begin{description}
% \item[\texttt{sidebar}:]  Place formatted text in the margin.
% \item[\texttt{marginfigure}:] Place a figure in the margin.
% \item[\texttt{margintable}:] Place a table in the margin.
% \end{description}

% %%
% %% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
% %% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
% %% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
% %% consistent spelling of the heading.
% \begin{acks}
% To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
% \end{acks}

% %%
% %% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
% %% the bibliography file.
% \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
% \bibliography{sample-base}


% %%
% %% If your work has an appendix, this is the place to put it.
